## Code Review & style (50/50 pts)

Here we look at your code to check for proper style and legibility.
1. Your code has to meet the requirements described in the homework pdf file.
2. It has to a proper python code.
3. Your logic has to correct.
4. You may pass our test cases but loose points in this section.
5. You may also fail test cases but get points in this section if your code is reasonable at some degree.

- Problem 1:
    - `c`: 10/10
    - TA Comments: Just a general comment that you can use print to test your code but when you are done and are sure that everything works- you can just comment out the print statements again so that the program doesn't print to the screen. The prints have actually served their purpose so we don;t need them. You don't want to remove them because we may specifically want to see some output from your code so we may un-comment them but yeah - generally it's a good idea to comment them out after you are done.
