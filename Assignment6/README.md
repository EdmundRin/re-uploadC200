## Code Review & style (50/50 pts)

Here we look at your code to check for proper style and legibility.
1. Your code has to meet the requirements described in the homework pdf file.
2. It has to be a proper python code.
3. Your logic has to be correct.
4. You may pass our test cases but lose points in this section.
5. You may also fail test cases but get points in this section if your code is reasonable at some degree.


- Problem 1:
    - `C`: 4/4
    - `B`: 6/6
    - TA Comments: Good job!.


- Problem 2:
    - `get_data`: 4/4
    - `pop`: 3/3
    - `error`: 3/3
    - TA Comments: Good job!.


- Problem 3:
    - `isogram`: 10/10
    - TA Comments: Good job!.


- Problem 4:
    - `Hex`: 10/10
    - TA Comments: Good job!.


- Problem 5:
    - `div_11`: 10/10
    - TA Comments:   
      - Logic is only half correct.
      - For eg: 909095 is a number which is divisible by 11, yet your function outputs 'False' for this number.
      - You want to keep running your logic as long as the difference between the even_sum and odd_sum is more than 11. In the current logic, you only run the logic once.
